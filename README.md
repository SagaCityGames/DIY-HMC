## Hardware

* Tactical helmet with NVG shroud, adult-sized (~$40)

* iPhone with ARKit functionality (I'm using iPhone X)

* OPTION 1: 3d printed NVG-mounted arm (as opposed to a "selfie stick")

* OPTION 2: bendable selfie stick (so it's stiff, but can be adjusted) - possibly just duct taped to top of helmet
