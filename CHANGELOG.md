# Changelog

* v0.1: works but flimsy (broke within 5 min) and too short to continuously capture whole face 

* v1.0: 100% infill the NVG mount, lengthened the 2 `arm 90 straight`. Works and is fairly durable.

* v2.0: To add more stability, this removes the 3D-printed `camera mount` and adds 3D-printed `Arm Axis Changer v5`
